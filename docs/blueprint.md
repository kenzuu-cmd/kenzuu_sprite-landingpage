# **App Name**: Sprite Scroll

## Core Features:

- Parallax WebP Animation: Implement a full-screen hero section where the background is a WebP image sequence. Map the scroll position directly to the WebP frame index for smooth, scroll-controlled animation. Animate forward when scrolling down and reverse when scrolling up.
- Configurable Drink Details: Allow the user to modify the drink name, subtitle, and description, which will update in the hero section of the site.
- Theme Customization: Implement light/dark mode toggle and allow customization of the theme color. The theme color applies to CTA hover states, accent lines and highlights.
- Hero Text Overlay: Overlay the brand logo, drink name, subtitle, descriptive paragraph, and CTA buttons directly on top of the animated background in the hero section.
- Navigation Bar: Implement a sticky top navigation bar with smooth-scroll links to different sections of the page (Product, Ingredients, Nutrition, Reviews, FAQ, Contact). Highlight the active section upon scroll.
- Loading Overlay: Implement a loading overlay that displays the Sprite logo or wordmark and a horizontal loading bar while the WebP sequence preloads.
- Intelligent Prompt Tool: Utilize generative AI to help determine the text/phrasing in CTAs or ad copy on the landing page using intelligent analysis of provided prompts to influence wording of call to actions. The AI LLM reasons about whether, and when to suggest content, depending on context.

## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: Sprite green (#00AE5F) to represent the brand's core identity and refreshing lemon-lime flavor.
- Background color: Dark charcoal (#222222) for a premium, cinematic feel, creating contrast with the bright primary color.
- Accent color: Light lime green (#BFFF00), an analogous color to the primary that serves as an attention-grabbing highlight in hover states.
- Body and headline font: 'Inter', a grotesque sans-serif font for a modern and objective look.
- Use minimal, monochrome social icons in the hero section and footer.
- Full-screen hero section with edge-to-edge parallax WebP animation and text overlay on the left side. Maintain a clean and open center area to showcase the background animation.
- Smooth and responsive parallax animation tied directly to scroll position for a cinematic feel. Subtle highlight animations on CTA hover states.
